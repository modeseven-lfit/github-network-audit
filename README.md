# GitHub Network Audit

Collect outbound network connection data from GitHub Actions workflow
runs that use
[step-security/harden-runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner).

This tool gathers network endpoint data from the StepSecurity API and
builds consolidated allowlists for use with harden-runner's
`egress-policy: block` mode.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install -e .
```

## Usage

### Collect Data

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
# Set your GitHub token (needed for repo enumeration via GraphQL)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"

# Collect data for the entire org
github-network-audit collect --org lfreleng-actions

# Collect data for a specific repo
github-network-audit collect --org lfreleng-actions --repo path-check-action

# Force refresh of cached data
github-network-audit collect --org lfreleng-actions --refresh
```

### Generate Reports

```bash
# All formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
github-network-audit report --org lfreleng-actions

# Specific format
github-network-audit report --org lfreleng-actions --output-format md

# Report for specific repo
github-network-audit report --org lfreleng-actions --repo path-check-action
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Output

The tool writes reports to the `{org}/` directory:

- `all_endpoints.json` - Complete endpoint inventory
- `allowlist.json` - Deduplicated allowlist with metadata
- `allowlist.csv` - Spreadsheet-friendly format
- `allowlist.md` - Markdown with harden-runner config snippet

Use `--repo` to produce repo-scoped output files
(e.g. `allowlist_path-check-action.json`).

## Data Sources

- **GitHub GraphQL API** - Repository enumeration (single query)
- **StepSecurity API** - Network endpoint data (unauthenticated)

The tool caches all data locally for idempotent operation.

## Notes

All intermediate data persists on disk. Follow-up runs use cached data
by default. Use `--refresh` to force re-fetching from APIs.

## VEXXHOST Infrastructure

The Linux Foundation uses [VEXXHOST](https://vexxhost.com/) for some
infrastructure needs, running servers and software in their data centres.
Projects whose GitHub Actions workflows may need to reach other Linux
Foundation hosted services should include the IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks
listed in [`resources/VEXXHOST.txt`](resources/VEXXHOST.txt) in their
outbound allowlists to avoid blocking legitimate traffic. Because provider
allocations can change over time, verify or refresh these ranges
against VEXXHOST's current published network information (see the
source URL in the resource file) when troubleshooting blocked
egress.
